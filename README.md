# Electronic List Facility (ELF)
_Including the `naughtyornice` library_

This is a very simple app for checking whether someone is on the naughty list or the nice list.
It also serves as an example of how to publish a simple Android library module, specifically
the `naughtyornice` module, to Bintray.

Thanks to [@maxspencer](https://github.com/maxspencer) for his help with publishing the library.
